# RunicV1

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.


This is the start of Runic, a project I've been dwelling on for a while. The entirety of the project is currently stored through Azure Devops, as they offer free use of Git LFS. The source code is also stored through GitHub for easier viewing.

Additionally, this project is meant to demonstrate personal working knowledge of C++ and Computer Science fundamentals, as well as an ability to quickly learn, implement, and integrate with an existing codebase.

Further information and any updates to the project will be summarized in the Devlogs folder, feel free to take a look.
