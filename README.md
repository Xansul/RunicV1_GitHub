# RunicV1

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.


This is the start of Runic, a project I've been dwelling on for a while. The entirety of the project is currently stored through Azure Devops, as they offer free use of Git LFS. This GitHub repository contains some of the source code for easier viewing, however the most current code will always be on Azure, as that is where regular updates are pushed. Feel free to contact me if you would like to view the Azure repository.

Additionally, this project is meant to demonstrate personal working knowledge of C++ and Computer Science fundamentals, as well as an ability to quickly learn, implement, and integrate with an existing codebase.

Further information and any updates for this repository will be summarized in the Devlogs folder, feel free to take a look.
