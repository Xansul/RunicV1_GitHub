# RunicV1

Developed with Unreal Engine 5


This is the start of Runic, a project I've been dwelling on for a while. The entirety of the project is currently stored through Azure Devops, as they offer free use of Git LFS. The source code is also stored through GitHub for easier viewing.

Further information and any updates to the project will be summarized in the Devlogs folder, feel free to take a look.
